### Materials

This is a rough draft of what materials I am using

- Shelves -- structure to hold all components
- Fish tank (40 gallon) -- for fish
- planter boxes with drain holes -- house the vegetation
- Bucket -- Act as a reservoir and filter
- Piping -- Move the water to all the parts
- PVC pass through -- Move water between the reservoir and planters
- Pumps -- Move the water
- Temp sensors -- ensure appropriate temps for each phase
- Solenoid flow switch -- control the path of water
